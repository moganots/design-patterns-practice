Name;Type;Description
Abstract factory;Creational pattern;Provide an interface for creating맍amilies맖f related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
Builder;Creational pattern;Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.
Dependency Injection;Creational pattern;A class accepts the objects it requires from an injector instead of creating the objects directly.
Factory method;Creational pattern;Define an interface for creating a맙ingle맖bject, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
Lazy initialization;Creational pattern;"Tactic of delaying the creation of an object, the calculation of a value, or some other expensive process until the first time it is needed. This pattern appears in the GoF catalog as ""virtual proxy"", an implementation strategy for theProxy맗attern."
Multiton;Creational pattern;Ensure a class has only named instances, and provide a global point of access to them.
Object pool;Creational pattern;Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use. Can be considered a generalisation of맊onnection pool마nd맚hread pool맗attern.
Prototype;Creational pattern;Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects from the 'skeleton' of an existing object, thus boosting performance and keeping memory footprints to a minimum.
Resource acquisition is initialization;Creational pattern;Ensure that resources are properly released by tying them to the lifespan of suitable objects.
Singleton;Creational pattern;Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
Adapter;Structural pattern;Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. An adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. The enterprise integration pattern equivalent is the translator.
Wrapper;Structural pattern;Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. An adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. The enterprise integration pattern equivalent is the translator.
Translator;Structural pattern;Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. An adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. The enterprise integration pattern equivalent is the translator.
Bridge;Structural pattern;Decouple an abstraction from its implementation allowing the two to vary independently.
Composite;Structural pattern;Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
Decorator;Structural pattern;Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically keeping the same interface. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
Extension object;Structural pattern;Adding functionality to a hierarchy without changing the hierarchy.
Facade;Structural pattern;Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
Flyweight;Structural pattern;Use sharing to support large numbers of similar objects efficiently.
Front controller;Structural pattern;The pattern relates to the design of Web applications. It provides a centralized entry point for handling requests.
Marker;Structural pattern;Empty interface to associate metadata with a class.
Module;Structural pattern;Group several related elements, such as classes, singletons, methods, globally used, into a single conceptual entity.
Proxy;Structural pattern;Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
Twin;Structural pattern;Twin allows modeling of multiple inheritance in programming languages that do not support this feature.
Blackboard;Behavioral pattern;Artificial intelligence맗attern for combining disparate sources of data (see막lackboard system)
Chain of responsibility;Behavioral pattern;Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
Command;Behavioral pattern;Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for the parameterization of clients with different requests, and the queuing or logging of requests. It also allows for the support of undoable operations.
Interpreter;Behavioral pattern;Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.
Iterator;Behavioral pattern;Provide a way to access the elements of an마ggregate맖bject sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
Mediator;Behavioral pattern;Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes맓oose coupling막y keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it allows their interaction to vary independently.
Memento;Behavioral pattern;Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state allowing the object to be restored to this state later.
Null object;Behavioral pattern;Avoid null references by providing a default object.
Observer;Behavioral pattern;Define a one-to-many dependency between objects where a state change in one object results in all its dependents being notified and updated automatically.
Publish Subscribe;Behavioral pattern;Define a one-to-many dependency between objects where a state change in one object results in all its dependents being notified and updated automatically.
Servant;Behavioral pattern;Define common functionality for a group of classes. The servant pattern is also frequently called helper class or utility class implementation for a given set of classes. The helper classes generally have no objects hence they have all static methods that act upon different kinds of class objects.
Specification;Behavioral pattern;Recombinable막usiness logic말n aBoolean맍ashion.
State;Behavioral pattern;Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
Strategy;Behavioral pattern;Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
Template method;Behavioral pattern;Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
Visitor;Behavioral pattern;Represent an operation to be performed on instances of a set of classes. Visitor lets a new operation be defined without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
Fluent Interface;Behavioral pattern;Design an API to be method chained so that it reads like a DSL. Each method call returns a context through which the next logical method call(s) are made available.
Active Object;Concurrency pattern;Decouples method execution from method invocation that reside in their own thread of control. The goal is to introduce concurrency, by using마synchronous method invocation마nd a맙cheduler맍or handling requests.
Balking;Concurrency pattern;Only execute an action on an object when the object is in a particular state.
Binding properties;Concurrency pattern;Combining multiple observers to force properties in different objects to be synchronized or coordinated in some way.[22]
Compute kernel;Concurrency pattern;The same calculation many times in parallel, differing by integer parameters used with non-branching pointer math into shared arrays, such asGPU-optimizedMatrix multiplication맖rConvolutional neural network.
Double-checked locking;Concurrency pattern;"Reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock by first testing the locking criterion (the 'lock hint') in an unsafe manner; only if that succeeds does the actual locking logic proceed. Can be unsafe when implemented in some language/hardware combinations. It can therefore sometimes be considered an마nti-pattern."
Event-based asynchronous;Concurrency pattern;Addresses problems with the asynchronous pattern that occur in multithreaded programs.[23]
Guarded suspension;Concurrency pattern;Manages operations that require both a lock to be acquired and a precondition to be satisfied before the operation can be executed.
Join;Concurrency pattern;Join-pattern provides a way to write concurrent, parallel and distributed programs by message passing. Compared to the use of threads and locks, this is a high-level programming model.
Lock;Concurrency pattern;"One thread puts a ""lock"" on a resource, preventing other threads from accessing or modifying it.[24]"
Messaging design pattern;Concurrency pattern;Allows the interchange of information (i.e. messages) between components and applications.
Monitor object;Concurrency pattern;An object whose methods are subject to맔utual exclusion, thus preventing multiple objects from erroneously trying to use it at the same time.
Reactor;Concurrency pattern;A reactor object provides an asynchronous interface to resources that must be handled synchronously.
Read-write lock;Concurrency pattern;Allows concurrent read access to an object, but requires exclusive access for write operations. An underlying semaphore might be used for writing, and aCopy-on-write맔echanism may or may not be used.
Scheduler;Concurrency pattern;Explicitly control when threads may execute single-threaded code.
Thread pool;Concurrency pattern;A number of threads are created to perform a number of tasks, which are usually organized in a queue. Typically, there are many more tasks than threads. Can be considered a special case of the맖bject pool맗attern.
Thread-specific storage;Concurrency pattern;"Static or ""global"" memory local to a thread."
Safe Concurrency with Exclusive Ownership;Concurrency pattern;Avoiding the need for runtime concurrent mechanisms, because exclusive ownership can be proven. This is a notable capability of the Rust language, but compile-time checking isn't the only means, a programmer will often manually design such pattern into code - omitting the use of locking mechanism because the programmer assesses that a given variable is never going to be concurrently accessed.
CPU atomic operation;Concurrency pattern;x86 and other CPU architectures support a range of atomic instructions that guarantee memory safety for modifying and accessing primitive values (integers). For example, two threads may both increment a counter safely. These capabilities can also be used to implement the mechanisms for other concurrency pattern as above. TheC#맓anguage uses theInterlocked맊lass for these capabilities.
